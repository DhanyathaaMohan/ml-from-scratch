\# Linear Regression Mini Project – Student Score Predictor



This mini project demonstrates \*\*Linear Regression implemented from scratch\*\* using NumPy.

The model predicts a student's score based on the number of hours studied.



This project is part of the \*\*ml-from-scratch\*\* repository, where machine learning algorithms

are implemented without using high-level ML libraries.

\## 📌 Problem Statement



Predict student scores based on the number of hours studied using Linear Regression.



---



\## 📊 Dataset



A small, simple dataset is used directly inside the notebook:



| Hours Studied | Score |

|--------------|-------|

| 1            | 2     |

| 2            | 4     |

| 3            | 6     |

| 4            | 8     |

| 5            | 10    |
